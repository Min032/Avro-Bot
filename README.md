# Avro bot

<b>
Avro bot will notify you whenever a site changes its content! All you have to do is specify the sites you're interested in.</br>
Once you follow an url, the bot will store your chat id, url and current webpage content hashed. Every 60 seconds, bot is monitoring all of the urls in the database and checks if the hash has changed since the last monitor. If it did, it sends a message to the corresponding chat.
